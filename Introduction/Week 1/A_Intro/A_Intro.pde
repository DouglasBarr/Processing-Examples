Processing is a programming language and development environment created at MIT in 2001

It is based on Java (and in fact any Java code will work in Processing) and it also incorporates
a lot of OpenGL functionality.

You can read about Java here: http://www.java.com/en/about/

and OpenGL here: http://www.opengl.org/about/
and read a recent article about it here: http://www.extremetech.com/gaming/133824-valve-opengl-is-faster-than-directx-even-on-windows

// Another way that we can write comments is using a double forward slash at the start of a line
// If we use this method then we need to put // at the start of each line

// So:
